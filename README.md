# *Iroha*
#### To-do list
* [ ] Parse and display v1 recollections as Wikia codes
* [ ] Update all recollection-related functions
* [x] List all event recollections for each Writer's Register entry correctly

    * [ ] ~~Translate the extracted v2 recollection file into Wikia codes~~
        * ~~*A JavaScript compiler is needed here?*~~
    * [ ] A menu that allows which function of Iroha to stop working (e.g. stop grabbing dining menu repeatedly)

* ***Bugs:***
    - [X] Memoria: Non-writer characters featured in memoria cards are displayed with untranslated names

This project is a small extension used to collect materials and data from the Japanese browser game *Bungo to Alchemist* (lit. *Writers and Alchemists*). The plugin was written to support the maintenance and update of [the game's Wikia](https://bungo.fandom.com) and has been passed down among the Wikia's staff.

Originally, the extension was first written by the OP [Sen](https://bungo.fandom.com/User:Senelio) and developed further by [Chocs](https://bungo.fandom.com) to version 1.7 (aka *Irochoco 7*).
