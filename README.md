## About
* ***Latest released version:*** 2.5.1

This project is a small extension used to collect materials and data from the Japanese browser game *Bungo to Alchemist* (lit. *Writers and Alchemists*). The plugin was written to support the maintenance and update of [the game's Wikia](https://bungo.fandom.com) and has been passed down among the Wikia's staff.

Originally, the extension was first written by the OP [Sen](https://bungo.fandom.com/User:Senelio) and developed further by [Chocs](https://bungo.fandom.com) to version 1.7 (aka *Irochoco 7*).
