VERSION 2.3

Such as hassle to remember collecting things that Iroha does not collect and scrolling through what
she has collected million times, so her partner decided to teach her to get more things and whatnot

+ New features & improvements:
  - Grab Chief Librarian's VC on the payday
  - Limit displayed delving VCs and sprites to those of new or ring-equipped writers
  - Limit repeating displaying of VC when kaika-ing a writer

+ Bug fixes:
  - Memoria transcription parsing names of non-writer characters
  - dining_hall VCs are caught but not displayed
  - New reports' memorias are not shown right upon refresh
  - Correct typo(?) in Kyoshi's name and match Mori's in-game kanji writing

* Testing feature: Display kaika stat changes by node as a writer is being kaika'ed

=======================================================
VERSION 2.2.1

As requested, the transmigration VC for summoned writers with proper naming.

as-correct-as-possible and a list of recollection claimable from Taint Books Delves

+ Translating names of regular (i.e. non-event) tainted books
+ Grabbing more VCs
